# Gibct Data Service
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/gibct-data-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/gibct-data-service)

The GIBCT Data Service is a tool to compile and construct the database from several independent sources. These sources, in the form of CSVs or APIs, are imported into the tool and compiled to produce the GI Bill Comparison Tool database, as well as a csv containing the stakeholder-relevant data for each school in the database.

## Developer Setup

1. Install Ruby 2.3. (It is suggested to use a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) and then to [install Ruby 2.3](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions)).
1. Install Bundler to manager dependencies: `gem install bundler`
1. Setup the database: `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
1. Load test users: `bundle exec rake db:seed` (User: `marc@va.gov`, Password: `marcmarc`)
1. Start the application: `bundle exec rails s`

## Commands
- `bundle exec rake lint` - Run the full suite of linters on the codebase.
- `bundle exec guard` - Runs the guard test server that reruns your tests after files are saved. Useful for TDD!
- `bundle exec rake security` - Run the suite of security scanners on the codebase.
- `bundle exec rake ci` - Run all build steps performed in Travis CI.

## Deployment Instructions
